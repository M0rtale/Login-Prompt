# Login-Prompt
Login Prompt for your pCheat

Put your php file in your /var/www/html/pSoftwareUffYa and redirect links in the client and admin solution to the corresponding php file.

In your mysql, create a user with username MeServer and password MeServer and create a database named dbname

create table users with columns Id(VARCHAR(255)) ActivationTime(INT) and hwid(VARCHAR(255))

Did this only as a joke with friends, to prove that Chinese login prompts are shit to make.

by default each user has 30day of using time, not sure if expiration works...
